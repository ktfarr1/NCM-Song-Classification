Stop fucking overfitting to the training data
	Jesus Christ

clustering neuronal data
	Clustering blindly, comparing to actual labels (Songs, then add additional labels)
	Use clusters to improve classification

Dimensionality reduction
	Attempt to pre-process neuronal data to reduce noise/complexity and aid in classification

clustering song properties (clustering problem? Figure out what kind of problem this is (Cla,R,Clu,DR)) (Check out NLP in machine learning)
	Picking apart songs into their component parts (making sure it uses contiguous pieces)
	Classifying/Correlating between song features and neuronal responses
		Beyond song "pieces" find different ways of comparing song elements (frequency, entropy, etc.)
